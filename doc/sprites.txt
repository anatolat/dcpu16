This is a theoretical sprite spec for a DCPU16 machine
It requires 32 words for sprite registers. 
The location of those registers is deliberately left undefined, because they are not relevant to the sprite design itself.

16 sprites

Each sprite has two control words

first control word is 
XXXXXXXXYYYYYYYY 
   8 bits X position 
   8 bits Y Position.

Second control word is
MMCCCCAAAAAAAAAA
   2 bits Sprite Mode allowing 4 sprite modes
   4 bits Colour info (meaning depends on sprite mode)
   10 bits for sprite data address 
      Sprite data is at 1000 0AAA AAAA AAA0
      Which is to say 0x8000 + (A << 1)

4 sprite modes
   Sprite Mode 0:  8x8  15 colour sprite with transparancy
      Sprite data is 4 bits per pixel, two machine words per line
      color info indicates which colour index is transparent

   Sprite Mode 1:  16x8  3 colour sprite with Transparancy
      Sprite data is 2 bits per pixel two machine words per line
      
   Sprite Mode 2:  8x16  3 colour sprite with Transparancy
      Sprite data is 2 bits per pixel one machine word per line
    
   Sprite Mode 3:  16x16  1 colour plus Transparancy
      Sprite Data is 1 bit per pixel one machine word per line
      ZERO bits are transparent,  ONE bits are the colour indicated
      by colour info
